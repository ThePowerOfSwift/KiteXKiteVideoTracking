# KiteXKiteVideoTracking
iOS realtime kite tracking and control

# Build
Use get submodule to retrive GPUImage2 (on the root git folder run the following command)
git submodule update --init --recursive

Note: Carthage has been used to get and build the StarScream (WebSocket Library) framework. The framework is checked in into source control, so it should work out of the box
